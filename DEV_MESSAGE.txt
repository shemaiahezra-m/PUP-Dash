To all PUP Dash players,

Thank you for playing our game! We poured our hearts and teamwork into making this project for you.
We hope you enjoy the challenge, the fun, and the spirit of PUP Sto. Tomas in every round.

This game was created by:
- Luige Malaiba
- Shemaiah Ezra
- Jayson Tuiza
- Jex Estanol

It all started with a joke: "What if yung hustle sa PUP gawing game?"
On June 6, 2025, we began turning that idea into reality.
From that moment, PUP Dash was born out of laughter, friendship, and the desire to share our campus experience in a fun way.
PUP Dash became our finals project for Programming 2, first year.
We hope it inspires you as much as it challenged us!

We appreciate your support and feedback.
Good luck, have fun, and always strive for excellence!

Mabuhay ang PUPians!
