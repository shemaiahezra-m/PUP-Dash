# PUP Dash!

**PUP Dash** is a fast-paced campus service game where you play as Pio P., the ever-reliable student helper. Your mission? Fulfill random requests from classrooms across the university — whether it’s a key, a remote, or a projector.

Start at the Guard House, grab the right key, head to the Storage for items, and deliver them on time. Each successful request earns you points, while mistakes cost you strikes. The game never stops, so hustle smart, aim for a high score, and see how long you can keep the campus running!
